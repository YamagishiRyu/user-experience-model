# User Experience Model: Sightseeing Recommendation

User Experience Recommedation is the academic project for sightseeing recommendation.
We propose two probablistic models(B-UEM, ST-UEM) to analyze user experience and to recommend not only locations but also what user do there.

This project includes dataset based on flickr and program for data processing, inference and evaluation. 
We prepare README for dataset and program.
